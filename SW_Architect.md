### Technical architect 

A technical architect can also be called application architect or software architect. A technical architect is responsible for software design and development. The technical architect works with the organization in terms of engineering and is more focused on defining technical details for software development by a team. They also work across the organization to understand how integration will work alongside other parts of the software module, which may be managed by other groups.

A technical architect can manage the details of API design and define API performance and scaling aspects. They make sure that the software is being developed consistently with the organization's standards and that they can easily integrate with another component.

The technical architect is a point of contact for any technical question related to the engineering team and will have the ability to troubleshoot the system as required. For a small software development project, you may not see a technical architect role, as a senior engineer may take up that role and work on software architecture design.

The technical architect mentors and supports the software engineering team by working closely with them and resolving any hindrance that arises from cross-team integration or business requirements.
